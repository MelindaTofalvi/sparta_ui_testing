## Introduction
This set of work involves looking into automating data on a website also grabbing it and using it alongside rspec . Within this repo you will find examples of array, hash and json data usage and manipulation.

## Getting started
Simply clone the repository to your computer to get started with this rspec introduction. The rspec gem should be included with base Ruby. Checkout the rspec documentation to brush up on general use of rspec.

## Prerequisites
This was done in Ruby 2.4.0 older versions may not be compatible. see here for instructions on updating your Ruby version (on Mac) Also you need selenium installed on your machine.

## Running Tests
In general run the following command in your terminal to get the results of your rspec tests.

```
rspec file_name.rb
```
Or if you just want to automate data without rspec just type this command
```
ruby file_name.rb
```
Built With
Ruby and rspec and selenium!
